        <h2>Effects of Water Pollution</h2>
        <p>Water pollution has far-reaching effects on both the environment and human health. Polluted water impacts ecosystems, poses serious health risks, affects economies, and is closely linked to climate change. Understanding these consequences is crucial for taking action against water pollution.</p>

        <!-- Ecosystem Damage -->
        <article>
            <h3>Impact on Ecosystems</h3>
            <p>Polluted water harms marine life, coral reefs, and fish populations. It disrupts the balance of ecosystems, leading to the loss of biodiversity and affecting food chains.</p>

        <!-- Human Health Risks -->
        <article>
            <h3>Human Health Risks</h3>
            <p>Contaminated water can lead to waterborne diseases such as cholera, dysentery, and diarrhea. Long-term exposure to polluted water can cause serious health issues like cancer and liver damage.</p>

        <!-- Economic Impact -->
        <article>
            <h3>Economic Impact</h3>
            <p>Water pollution affects various industries like tourism, fishing, and agriculture, leading to significant financial losses. It also reduces the availability of clean water, increasing costs for water treatment.</p>

        <!-- Climate Change Connection -->
        <article>
            <h3>Climate Change Connection</h3>
            <p>Water pollution and climate change are interconnected. Pollution affects water quality, and in turn, climate change exacerbates water scarcity and pollution, creating a vicious cycle.</p>
