        <h2>Causes of Water Pollution</h2>
        <p>Water pollution is caused by a variety of factors, from industrial waste to agricultural runoff. Understanding these causes helps us address the root of the problem. Below are the major causes contributing to the global water pollution crisis.</p>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h3>Industrial Pollution</h3>
            <p>Factories discharge waste directly into water bodies, leading to contamination with hazardous chemicals such as heavy metals, toxins, and oils. These pollutants harm aquatic life and can make water unsafe for human consumption.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h3>Agricultural Runoff</h3>
            <p>Pesticides and fertilizers used in agriculture wash into rivers and oceans, causing harmful algal blooms and affecting the quality of water. These chemicals can be toxic to aquatic life and disrupt ecosystems.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h3>Plastic Waste</h3>
            <p>Plastic pollution, including microplastics, severely affects marine life. Plastic waste, which often takes centuries to degrade, clogs waterways and harms aquatic organisms, leading to injuries or death.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h3>Sewage and Wastewater</h3>
            <p>Untreated sewage and wastewater are frequently released into rivers and lakes, introducing harmful bacteria, viruses, and chemicals. This practice poses significant risks to public health and disrupts ecosystems.</p>
