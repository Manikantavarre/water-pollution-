        <!-- Lack of Awareness -->
        <article>
            <h3>Lack of Awareness</h3>
            <p>Many people are unaware of the severity of water pollution and its long-term effects on health and the environment. Without proper education and awareness campaigns, it's difficult to mobilize communities for action.</p>

        <!-- Plastic Pollution -->
        <article>
            <h3>Plastic Pollution</h3>
            <p>Plastic waste continues to be a major contributor to water pollution. Its non-biodegradable nature means it accumulates in water bodies, harming marine life and ecosystems. Reducing plastic consumption and improving recycling processes are crucial to solving this challenge.</p>

        <article>
            <h3>Untreated Sewage and Wastewater</h3>
            <p>In many developing regions, sewage and wastewater treatment infrastructure is lacking. As a result, untreated waste is dumped directly into rivers, lakes, and oceans, which contaminates water and spreads diseases. Investment in sewage treatment plants is essential to address this issue.</p>

        <!-- Climate Change -->
        <article>
            <h3>Climate Change</h3>
            <p>Climate change is both a result and a driver of water pollution. Changes in temperature and weather patterns affect water quality, while floods and droughts exacerbate water scarcity and contamination. Addressing climate change is a critical part of the solution to water pollution.</p>
